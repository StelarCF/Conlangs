Flora&fauna OOC note: Nearly identical to our world; origin and place may vary. I'll use english words for animals and plants and anatomy when translating. Anatomy also identical to human anatomy. Geography not similar, see map.

Proto-Kwa'in is a pre-agricultural language that is the ancestor of all languages on the Kwain continent. The early kwaini were hunter gatherers. They possessed limited tools, generally relating to processing fruit and prey into more edible food. By this time they were known to use fire. Only one type of animal was domesticated, the dog, generally used for hunting and protecting camps. They also are known to use spears

They classified the world into two groups - prey, predators (from their perspective) and birds. Only few animals received names this early, including wolves, dogs and humans.
