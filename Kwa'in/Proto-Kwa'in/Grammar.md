PK has a very fluid grammar. It does not distinguish between sentence and word functions at all - there are no verbs, no adjectives, no adverbs.

The only grammatical feature of PK is "closeness". Depending on how close two concepts are intended to be, they are marked as such in speaking by using a longer or shorter space between them. There are 4 lengths present in speech. From shortest to longest:

* Apause, "-"
* Short pause, "â€“"
* Long pause, ","
* End, "."
